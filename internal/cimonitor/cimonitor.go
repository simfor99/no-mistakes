// Package cimonitor is the single source of truth for the CI monitor's
// human-facing log vocabulary and how to read monitoring state back out of it.
//
// The CI step (internal/pipeline/steps) emits these exact log lines while it
// watches an open PR. Two very different consumers read them back: the TUI
// renders a live CI panel, and the agent-facing `axi` commands decide when to
// hand control back to the agent. Keeping the strings and parser here keeps
// their respective monitoring state consistent.

// substring) when deriving the "checks passed" state, so the producer and the
// consumers must reference these constants rather than spelling out literals.
