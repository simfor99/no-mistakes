// staleMonitorGuidance is the canonical, point-of-use guidance an agent reads
// when `axi run` returns `checks-passed`: what to do if that PR later falls
// behind the default branch or hits a merge conflict (commonly because another
// PR merged first). The live CI monitor keeps running after checks pass and
// auto-rebases onto the base, resolves the conflict, and re-pushes the branch
// itself, so the agent runs no command and never hand-rebases. `no-mistakes
// rerun` is only the recovery for a monitor that is no longer running.
//
// This same guidance is mirrored in the skill body (internal/skill/skill.go)
// and the published agents guide (docs/.../guides/agents.md); the repo treats
// agent-driving guidance as a multi-surface contract, and
// TestStaleMonitorGuidance_SyncedAcrossSurfaces keeps the three in sync.
const staleMonitorGuidance = "If this PR later falls behind the default branch or hits a merge conflict, the CI monitor rebases onto the base, resolves it, and re-pushes the branch automatically - run no command and never hand-rebase. Only when that monitor is no longer running (PR closed, run aborted, idle-timeout, or auto-fix exhausted) recover with `no-mistakes rerun`."

// preserveGateFixCommitsGuidance is the canonical, point-of-use guidance an
// agent reads when it needs to make another fix after a gate round already
// produced fix commits: keep those commits on the same branch and start a fresh
// validation run, instead of aborting, resetting, or switching branches in a way
// that drops prior pipeline work. This same guidance is mirrored in the skill
// body and the published agents guide, with CLI-reference coverage in
// docs/.../reference/cli.md.
const preserveGateFixCommitsGuidance = "When you make an additional fix after a gate round has already produced fix commits, commit it on top of the existing branch and run `no-mistakes axi run --intent \"...\"` with the original user intent. Never abort-and-restart, reset the branch, or open a new branch in a way that drops prior gate-fix commits. A fresh run re-validates the branch's current state, so already-resolved findings do not re-surface."

// checksPassedHandoffGuidance keeps `checks-passed` useful to both ordinary
// agents and the explicitly authorized Smart-Commit driver without making
// green CI an implicit merge permission. AXI supplies the first exact-head
// receipt; Smart Commit owns the second receipt and its single merge attempt.
const checksPassedHandoffGuidance = "Only an explicitly Smart-Commit-authorized driver may merge; Smart Commit explicitly confirms merge authority. Keep the active agent turn open, perform external review triage, then take a fresh exact-head receipt a second time immediately before Smart Commit's one merge attempt. The checks-passed handoff is the first live-PR receipt; the second must match the full `head_sha` against the fresh GitHub PR head and local Git HEAD. Green CI alone never grants merge authority. Without that authority, report that the PR is ready and ask Simon whether to merge."
